Local Bash Config Scripts
=====

This repo is primarily intended for personal use, but feel free to borrow code or clone as you wish.

Best way to use this is to create a folder to clone into, and then simlink into $HOME.

I've tried to not use to many explicit definitions of local files, but I might have missed a few, so you may need to update a few elements of the scripts if you encounter errors!

Enjoy.
