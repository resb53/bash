Local Bash Config Scripts
=====

This repo is primarily intended for personal use, but feel free to borrow code or clone as you wish in accordance with LICENSE.md.

Best way to use this config for yourself is to create a folder to clone into, and then simlink into $HOME.

I've tried to not use to many explicit definitions of local files, but I might have missed a few, so you may need to update a few elements of the scripts if you encounter errors!

Enjoy.
